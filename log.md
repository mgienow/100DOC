# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Dug back into my personal "please hire me!" portfolio page after more than a month away from that work

**Thoughts:** Terribly ill with norovirus but started #100DOC anyway! Feel both horribly queasy and totally badass.

**Link to work:** {Portfolio Site} https://belligerent-crowd.gomix.me/

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Portfolio site CSS/HTML & media queries for responsiveness

**Thoughts**:  Still sick/woozy but managed another hour. Slow but steady wins the race


### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More media queries, both small and widescreen

**Thoughts**  still queasy, and two barfing kids home from school, but I DID MY HOUR OF CODE!!

### Day 4: 1/6/17

**Today's Progress**: Made my media queries more responsive - changed all the screen widths to 'em' units after a conversation with my FEWD teacher, Tom Kraak.

**Thoughts**: Anything worth doing is worth doing right -- or going back to do over. I appreciate learning from someone who believes in the discipline of pure code.

###DAy 5: 1/7/17:

**Today's Progress**: Playing with best presentation of the projects I'll be linking to through this portfolio site. HTML/CSS

**THoughts**: At MAGFest today, getting my freak on, and feeling very righteous to be doing my hour of code even when surrounded by such nerdvana...

###Day 6: 1/8/17

**Today's PRogress:**: sidestep into fixing up one of my earlier sites to make it worth of inclusion in the supaFINE portfolo HTML/CSS

**Thoughts** so much great work being done and on display at MAGFest indy game developer room, very inspiring to my own coding

##Day 7: 1/9/17

**Today's Progress:**: Markup on secondary portfolio pages

##Day8 1/10/17

**Today's Progress:**: worked on coding at my kids' robotics club meet. Portfolio site looking very good

##Day9 1/12/2017

**TOday's Progress:** : Day 9 DId my hour (and more) while my kid was sitting his entrance exam for CS magnet high school program. Go Jack!

##DAY 10 1/13/2017

**Today's PRogress:** wasted a great deal of time trying to position a logo on top of a background image in such a way that it looks good on all platforms. Great in Chrome, totally breaks in Safari, wtf???

##Day 11 1/14/2017

**TOday's PRogress:** still struggling with CSS positioning. Don't tell me it's all relative!  also: why must my fondness for fixed navs throw off any other ability to ever use CSS positioning?  really learning the difference between positioning and layout (flexbox does layout, not positioning)

##Day12 1/15/2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent today's coding time basically undoing all the HTML/CSS I did yesterday, dang it. Just one of those days...This AFTER i gave up and just did the logo/background overlay in photoshop the way i probably should have in the first palce. Two days wasted letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.

##Day13 1/16/2017

**Today's Progress**: Lucky Day 13 living up to its reputation - very frustrating day with flexbox, which i previously *thought* i understood!

##Day 14 1/17/17

**Todays progress:** that thing where you work all day on broken flexbox CSS then hours later find the dropped </div> in your markup...

##Day 15 1/18/17

**Today's Progress:**
one of those sweet days when it all goes right. Major progress. Portfolio site just about done. Feel the power of coding every day!

##Day 16 1/19/17

**Today's progress:**
Day 16 - finishing touches are so much fun! Finishing up my porftolio site and looking for the next challenge...

##Day17 1/20/2017

**TOday's progress**: took a break from HTML/CSS to do some JS coding. learning the ins and outs of array.prototype.sort() with compareFunction -- an IFFE passed in as an argument that allows sorting of arrays in different ways

**Link to the work**: https://github.com/mgienow/Codewars-exercises/blob/master/sum_Of_Two_Lowest_Positive_Integers.js

ALSO: FINALLY GOT LEGIT WITH GIT!!!!!

## Day18 1/21/2017

**TOday's progress**: Despite protest marching in Baltimore today, managed late evening coding. So that was progress even if my actual coding work was kinda not. Maybe the late hour explains why I mis-remembered how the slice() method works -- it removes an element from an array, yes, but returns that element in a new array.  I was looking for it to return the original array minus the target element. And oh the broken-ness....

## Day 19 1/22/2017

**Today's progress**: Put up my portfolio site for comments from the Baltim0re Free Code Camp community. Still things I need to do to it! Also joined Charm City JS today.  Spent 4 hours coding JS.

##Day 20 1/23/2017

**Today's progress**: making sure my portfolio site is responsive on mobile sizes in landscape.  arrrggghhh ihpone 4s!!

##Day21 1/24/2017

**Today's progress** more fine-tuning so that my site looks great on every apple device known to womankind.  forgot to push this to git yesterday tho i did manage to tweet and support some fellow #100daysofcode folks

##Day22 1/25/2017

**Today's progress** worked on Arctangent site to get it looking sharp for people to click through to from my portfolio.  moved everything to gomix for hosting.


## Day 23 1/26/2017

**Today's progress** spent some time on JS today, learning array method reduce(function(a,b) {a+b}); plus organizing my various web app projects to be consistent between two computers, two platforms, and GH.

##Day 24 1/27/2017

**Today's progress** Subtle but satisfying fine-tuning of the Arctangent gems page.  Looks great now!  My CSS is really on point. Today, anyway!

##Day 25 1/28/2017

**Today's progress** worked on final section of arctangent site,t he contact page. contact forms are just boxes within boxes, they ought to be easy, right?  Well. That remains to be seen.

ALSO:  Day 25 = one quarter of the way to the goal of 100 days. 100 Days of Code has been a true motivator and I am making progress on projects that have been stalled for months. Honestly, making more progress on concrete output that I can show potential employers than since I finished FEWD course 6 months ago -- it was 6 months ago today, come to think of it. In the interim I haven't been lazy, I've just been focused on learning JS, and learning is great but i don't exactly have a portfolio of JS work I can point to.  Probably time to get back to FCC and see what those algorithms are all about.

##Day 26 1/30/2017

**Today's progress** Worked on CLI rooting out malware in hidden directories, and then FCC javascript. Short work day.

## Day 27 1/31/2017

**Today's progress** Worked through FCC basic JS track. Good review, trying to get to the exercises they call algorithms that I hear are excellent coding practice

## Day 28 2/1/2017

**TOday's progress** More FCC, plus going back to refactor a codewars kata (Vasya Clerk challenge) that I had partially solved, but not for all test cases. Dusts hands.

## Day 29 2/2/2017

**Today's progress:** Trying to get all my projects organized so that they're consistent between laptop and desktop, plus various IDEs and hosting platforms I've been using. Being disorganized has cost me too much time and confusion when I just want to be coding!

## Day 30 2/3/2017

**Today's progress:** Worked through more of FCC's Basic JS section. Spent most of the time on the Profile Lookup exercise, which was quite challenging. It clarified that I had not adequately internalized how to access arrays nested within objects -- i.e., the syntax thereof.

## Day 31 2/4/2017

**Today's progress:** Very productive day! Finished FCC basic javascript course and moved into Object Oriented Programming section. Played around with a codewars kata (Title Case) but not able to solve it all the way.

## Day 32 2/5/2017

**Today's progress:** Still hacking away at the Title Case kata -- much closer to a working solution. Today's Free Code Camp studying -- object oriented programming and the .map() method for arrays -- came at a fortuitous time for this challenge!

link to the work: https://www.codewars.com/kata/title-case/train/javascript

And also trying to replicate a git commit snafu so i can solve it. But of course I can't because the car never makes the bad sounding noise when the mechanic is looking at it.

##Day 33 2/6/2017
**Today's progress:** figuring out how to deploy web apps from github onto netlify.  pretty cool stuff!
